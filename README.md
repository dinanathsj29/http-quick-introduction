- HTTP stands for `HyperText Transfer Protocol`
- HTTP is a set of rules and regulations ie. principles to accomplish Internet Communication/Data Transfer related tasks on the web (between Servers an Clients)
- Responsible for communication between Clients and Web Servers
- HTTP is child protocol of TCP/IP
- HTTP is stateless ie. every request is completely independent (each request is a single transaction, does not remember or dependent on past/before request)
- HyperText Transfer Protocol (Internet Communication/Data Transfer on the web). A set of rules (and a format) for data being transferred on the web in the form of HTML, image, audio, video, zip, etc.
- HTTP foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web/internet since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol that can be used for other purposes as well as using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers

> As soon as User opens `Web Browser and enter URL`, the user is indirectly making use of HTTP. HTTP mechanism sends/transfer/transit `REQUEST` to the webserver and fetches the `RESPONSE`/data from the webserver

> Every time we open a browser - visit and load pages, Submit Form, Button click for Ajax calls

- **Hyper Text**
  - Looks like a normal text but have some special effects/formattings
  - HyperText simply means `"Text within Text"`. A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other
  - Hypertext refers to how `Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together`. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext
  - Structured Text with links to other parts of a text, usually a web page
  - Usually defined using an HTML - in combination with other web technologies like CSS, JavaScript, etc.
